## On Campus Delivery(by Paityn Wynn)
## Description
In this project, I will use an existing database and enhance the functionality using MySQL by creating a rating system for the driver and the administrator.

## Use Case
1. Customers provide ratings after an order.
2. Customers also may search for ratings ona particular restaurant.
3. Administators of the system will be interested in looking at driver ratings and restaurant ratings.

## Business Rule

- This part of project illustrates a rating system between drivers and restaurants
- Customers can rate the driver and the restaurant only after the order is placed
- Customers can search ratings for only one restaurant at a time
- Administrators can search ratings for restaurants and drivers
